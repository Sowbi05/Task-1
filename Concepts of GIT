About Git:-
1. Distributed Version Control: refers to a version control system where the entire repository,
   including its full history and all branches, is mirrored on every developer's local machine.
2. Efficient Branching and Merging: A problem can be solved as small problems by branching and then can be merged easily.
3. Enhanced collaboration: GitHub offers a platform for issue tracking, pull requests, and community involvement. 
4. Social Coding Hub: Became a center for open-source projects and collaboration.  Enabled transparency, faster operations, 
  and simplified conflict resolution.

Concepts in Git:-
1. Repository: It is a collection of files and directories.
2. Commit: Commit refers to saving the changes made to the repository.
3. Branch: Branch allows to code seperately another problem and thereafter merging it. There is a default MAIN branch where
           codes are initially stored.
4. Pull request: It is a way to propose changes to a repository. It allows others to review and discuss the proposed 
            changes before merging them into the main branch.
5. Push: It is the process of uploading local changes to a remote repository.
6. Clone: Cloning is the process of creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. 
         This allows to start working with the codebase and history.
7. Forking: Forking in Git refers to the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's repository. 
          We can make changes to it without affecting the original project.
